There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one  contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?

————————————————————————————————————

ets assume:
box 1 is labelled Oranges (O)
box 2 is labelled Apples (A)
box 3 is labelled Apples and Oranges (A+O)
and that ALL THREE BOXES ARE LABELLED INCORRECTLY"

Pick a fruit from box 1,

1) if you pick an Orange:
- box 1's real label can only be O or A+O
- box 1's current label is O
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT then box 1's real label can not be O
- box 1's new label should then be A+O by elimination
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT
- box 2's label is changed to O
- box 3's label is changed to A
- SOLVED

2) if you pick an Apple:
- box 1's real label can only be A or A+O
- box 1's current label is O
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT then box 1's real label can not be O
- this still leaves us with the choice between label A and label A+O - which would both be correct
- FAILURE

Solution: The trick is to actually pick a fruit from the A+O labeled box

Pick a fruit from box 3:

1) if you pick an Orange:
- box 3's real label can only be O or A
- box 3's current label is A+O
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT then box 3's real label can not be A+O
- box 3's new label should then be O by elimination
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT
- box 1's label is changed to A
- box 2's label is changed to A+O
- SOLVED

2) if you pick an Apple:
- box 3's real label can only be O or A
- box 3's current label is A+O
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT then box 3's real label can not be A+O
- box 3's new label should then be A by elimination (not O)
- since ALL LABELS ARE INCORRECT
- box 1's label is changed to A+O
- box 2's label is changed to O
- SOLVED
